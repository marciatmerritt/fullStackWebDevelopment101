# Javascript Form Validation Project

This project is a basic form validation process to perform basic client-side validation on the form submitted by a user. Provided are two html files; Use the index.html and basic-validation.html files as a starting point for your form validation project. Your code should be able to work with either of these files. You should not have to change them in order to make your validation work. 

## Description

When clicking the submit button on any form contained on the page, the data entered will go through a validation process and error messages will be displayed on the screen directly above the input fields in the form. The list will not contain any duplicate error messages and will not indicate which fields contained the errors but the error messages will go away as you correct the errors on the screen. For fields that are not required, they will not be evaluated if they are left blank. Required size fields must match the minlength attribute found on the input field and the username must be at least 8 characters long.
