# Java War Exercise

## Description

War is a 2 player card game. The players each play a card face-up at the same time, and the player with the highest card takes the cards that were played. If the cards are the same value, then “war” begins. War consists of the players each putting 3 cards face-down followed by a 4th card face up card. The player with the highest face-up card takes all the cards in play. If the face-up cards are the same value again, then war is initiated again until one player has the higher card. The game ends when one player has won all the cards.
