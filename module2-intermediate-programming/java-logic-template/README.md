# Java Logic

This exercise contains basic logic problems using the Java programming language.

To complete the exercise, provide a working implementation for each method.

### Setup

1. Open the project in IntelliJ
2. Provide solutions to each of the methods in the LogicExercise class, following the instructions
   in the comments.

### Testing Your Solutions

A number of unit tests have been written to test the implementation of each method.

To test your solutions:

1. Make sure the test/java folder is Marked as the Test Sources Root (java folder should be green).
   If not, right click on the java folder and click Mark Directory as -> Test Sources Root.
2. Open the LogicExerciseTest class and right click on the test of the method you are trying to
   test. For example, the test named 'testGetGradeA' is testing the method getGrade with a value
   which should return 'A'.
3. A dialog should appear and indicate whether the test passed or failed.
4. To run all of the tests, you can right click on the LogicExerciseTest class and click Run
   LogicExerciseTest.

## Description

This project is a mixture of exercises to test your knowledge & understanding of Java. In the LogicExercise.java file, there are number of methods described below that each solve a different requirement. In the LogicExerciseTest, there are different test cases that are used to validate that each method is working.

### Logic Exercise Methods

1. getDiscount
   - Takes a BigDecimal for the unit price and an int for number of units sold and returns a discounted sales total based on the quantity sold. 
   
1. getGrade
   - Takes an int representing a percentile score and returns the appropriate letter grade.
   
1. removeEvenLength
   - Takes an ArrayList of strings, removes all the elements in the array containing an even number of letters, and then returns the result.

1. powerArray
   - Takes an double array, a, and returns a new array containing the square of each element in a.

1. indexOfMax
   - Takes an int array, a, and returns the index of the element with the greatest value.

1. isDivisibleBy
   - Takes an ArrayList of Integers, a, and returns true if all elements in thearray are divisible by the given int, i.

1. isAbecedarian
   - Takes String s and returns true if it is abecedarian. A word is "abecedarian" if its letters appear in alphabetical order

1. areAnagrams
   - Takes 2 strings and returns true if they are anagrams of each other.

1. countUniqueCharacters
   - Takes a String and returns the number of unique characters.

1. isPalindrome
   - Takes a string and returns true if it is a palindrome.

1. concordanceForString
   - Takes a string and returns a HashMap which is a map of characters to a list of their indices in a string.
