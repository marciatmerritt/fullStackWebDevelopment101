# Java Unit Testing Exercise :bug: :bug: :bug:

Zoology Inc. is hiring and requires a coding interview. They currently have quality issues,
and think that better unit testing will help them. As a result, their coding interview
includes a unit testing portion.

## Description

### Requirements:
:one: Write a solution for the Monkey trouble problem.

We have two monkeys, a and b, and the parameters aSmile and bSmile indicate if each is smiling. We are in trouble if they are both smiling or if neither of them is smiling. Return true if we are in trouble.

Possible input values and the expected return are as follows:

    MonkeyTrouble(true, true)   → true
    MonkeyTrouble(false, false) → true
    MonkeyTrouble(true, false)  → false
    MonkeyTrouble(false, true)  → false
   
:two: Provide unit tests to cover each of the test cases provided for the MonkeyTrouble
   problem.

 
### Stretch Requirements 
  (These are optional requirements for additional practice):

1. Expand MonkeyTrouble to include three monkeys.

1. Create additional test cases to handle all the new conditions.
