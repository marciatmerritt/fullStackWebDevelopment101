# SQL Queries


## Description
You have been provided with a dump file which contains data for college students and classes. The college has tasked you with writing the queries to perform a set of operations on the data. Create a new database and restore the dump file then answer the following questions using SQL statements.

### Setup Instructions
1. Using Git Bash, Clone the repository
2. Open pgAdmin and create a new database called **college**
3. Restore the dump file **college_export.backup**

This will restore the "college" database with the test data you will need to complete the SQL Queries Exercise.

### Requirements:
1. A new student has been accepted into the college, add his information to the students table: Dan Zanes.
2. Josie’s email was inputted incorrectly. Modify her email to be “jblair21@college.edu”.
3. The college is creating a directory of all student names and emails. To help, generate a list of all students in the format: <Last name, First name> <Email> with a heading of “Name” for the full name and “Email” for the email. Order the list alphabetically by last name.
4. Abe wants to see all of his recorded class grades. Create a list for him with the name of the class and the grade he received.
5. Joe Barnes has graduated and his information has been recorded in an alumni table. Delete his record from the students table.
6. The teacher of Introduction to Computer Science wants to see a list of all the grades in the class. Create a list with the full name of the student and the grade received in Introduction to Computer Science.


Stretch Requirements (These are optional requirements for additional practice):
